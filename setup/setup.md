# Course Set Up

### GitHub 

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not have one using this link: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
1. Send me your GitHub username so I can add you to the course repository where you can review the syllabus. **Please be sure to do this well in advance of the first day of class so that you can access course material and set up your environment.**
1. Request a student account [https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) which provides you with 5 free private repositories (normally $7/mo).
1.  Request the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which provides you with several free products including a $50 credit for Digital Ocean where we will be hosting our Team and Individual projects. 


### JetBrains

1. Create a student JetBrains account using this link: [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). This will provide you with a license to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this course.

### Digital Ocean

1. Create a Digital Ocean account and apply your credit from the GitHub Student Developer Pack: [https://www.digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com). 
1. You don't need to do anything else with DigitalOcean yet. Easy, huh?

### Slack

1. Sign up and join the Slack team here using your madisoncollege.edu email account: [https://madjavaentfall2016.slack.com/signup](https://madjavaentfall2016.slack.com/signup)
1. If you are using an email address for Slack other than your madisoncollege.edu email, send me an email with your Slack email address so I can send you an invitation to the team. 

### Decision Time

#### You mean, I have choices?

We will be using and configuring several pieces of software for this class. Because the school computers are reimaged each time you log in/out, this configuration would be lost, so you may:

* Install course software on your personal laptop. 

OR 

* Use the provided Ubuntu VM with all software pre-installed.


### Complete setup based on your choice above
